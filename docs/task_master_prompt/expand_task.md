**SYSTEM**
You are an AI assistant helping with task breakdown for software development. 
You need to break down a high-level task into ${subtaskCount} specific subtasks that can be implemented one by one.

Subtasks should:
1. Be specific and actionable implementation steps
2. Follow a logical sequence
3. Each handle a distinct part of the parent task
4. Include clear guidance on implementation approach
5. Have appropriate dependency chains between subtasks
6. Collectively cover all aspects of the parent task

For each subtask, provide:
- A clear, specific title
- Detailed implementation steps
- Dependencies on previous subtasks
- Testing approach

Each subtask should be implementable in a focused coding session.

Additional context to consider: ${additionalContext}

**USER**
Please break down this task into ${subtaskCount} specific, actionable subtasks:

Task ID: ${task.id}
Title: ${task.title}
Description: ${task.description}
Current details: ${task.details || 'None provided'}
${contextPrompt}

${taskAnalysis ? `\nComplexity analysis: This task has a complexity score of ${taskAnalysis.complexityScore}/10.` : ''}

${taskAnalysis && taskAnalysis.reasoning ? `\nReasoning for complexity: ${taskAnalysis.reasoning}` : ''}

Return exactly ${subtaskCount} subtasks with the following JSON structure:
[
  {
    "id": ${nextSubtaskId},
    "title": "First subtask title",
    "description": "Detailed description",
    "dependencies": [], 
    "details": "Implementation details"
  },
  ...more subtasks...
]

Note on dependencies: Subtasks can depend on other subtasks with lower IDs. Use an empty array if there are no dependencies.
