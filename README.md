# Airic - Personal AI Work Partner

Airic is a personal AI work partner that enables closer, more natural human-AI collaboration through innovative concepts like "Meta Documents" and "Guided Problem Decomposition".

## Concept

Airic is built around these core concepts:

- **Meta Document as Collaboration Cornerstone**: Documents are not just static records but the dynamic "source code" driving AI work â€“ a shared, evolving "brain" for the human-AI team.

- **Guided Problem Decomposition as Thinking Partner**: Airic actively assists users in breaking down complex problems through structured questioning and framework suggestions.

- **Everything is Document**: Inspired by Linux, the system treats core components like Agents, Tasks, Workflows, and even type definitions as structured Markdown documents within a workspace.
