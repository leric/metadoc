      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of setting up a Python project structure, implementing the 'airic init' command, creating required directories, ensuring workspace detection, and integrating Typer for CLI. Include subtasks for best practices in Python packaging and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard but multi-step setup: defining a Python package structure, implementing CLI commands, and ensuring workspace detection. While not algorithmically complex, it requires attention to best practices in Python packaging, directory management, and CLI integration, making it moderately complex.[6][9]"

      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to implement a REPL interface using prompt-toolkit, add command history, differentiate command vs. free text input, integrate Rich for output formatting, implement Markdown rendering and syntax highlighting, and create a dynamic status bar.",
      "reasoning": "Building a robust interactive CLI with REPL features, command parsing, history, and rich formatting requires integrating multiple libraries and handling user interaction edge cases. The need for Markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, and a dynamic status bar increases both cognitive and structural complexity.[2][4]"
